## This is the twelfth resubmission

* Updates since previous submission:
  * Fixed bug in `perlrren()` function that will now keep the predicted values even if NA
  * Fixed bug in `plot_perturb()` function that will now project rasters using `method = "bilinear"` for continuous values
  * Streamlined "test-perlrren.R" by removing duplicate tests for "incorrectly specified n_sim"
  * Fixed bug in "test-plot_cv.R" by resetting the graphics within an error check to clear a warning between tests
  
* Documentation for `pval_correct()` references a doi <https://doi.org/10.2307/2283989> that throws a NOTE but is a valid URL
