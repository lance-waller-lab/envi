## This is the sixteenth resubmission

* Updates since previous submission:
  * Migrated R-spatial dependencies
  * Replaced `raster`, `rgeos`, and `sp` packages in Imports with `terra` and `sf` because of imminent package retirements
  * Removed `maptools` from Suggests (replaced with new internal function `as.im.SpatRaster()`)
  * Updated test, examples, vignette, and documentation throughout
  
* Documentation for "envi-package.Rd", "pval_correct.Rd", DESCRIPTION, and vignette references the following DOIs, which throws a NOTE but are valid URLs:
