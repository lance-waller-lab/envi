## This is the thirteenth resubmission

* Actions taken regarding feedback from CRAN teams' auto-check service:
  * In the `div_plot()` and `seq_plot()` internal functions, replaced `if (class(input) == "im")` with `if (methods::is(input, "im"))`
  * Added `methods` package to Imports
  
* Updates since previous submission:
  * Re-added `utils` package to Suggests because "zzz.R" calls the `packageDescription()` function
  * Moved `spatstat.random` package from Imports to Suggests because the `rpoispp()` function is only used for tests
  
* Documentation for "man/envi-packge", man/pval_correct.Rd", and DESCRIPTION references the following DOIs, which throws a NOTE but are valid URLs:
