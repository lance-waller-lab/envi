## This is the ninth resubmission

* Updates since previous submission:
  * Removed `LazyData: true` from 'DESCRIPTION' file because the package has no data accessed via a `data()` command and has no `data/` directory (in response to CRAN NOTE: 'LazyData' is specified without a 'data' directory)
  * Following advice from `future` package maintainer, now `spatial_power()` and `jitter_power()` functions reset future strategy when exiting
  * Addressed ERROR in MacOS environments on rhub by setting the `parallelly.makeNodePSOCK.setup_strategy = sequential` for MacOS environments running `tcltk` until `parallelly` (>=1.26.1-9002) is on CRAN. This workaround was suggested by the `parallelly` maintainer <https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/parallelly/issues/62#issuecomment-880665390>
  
* Documentation for `pval_correct()` references a doi <https://doi.org/10.2307/2283989> that throws a NOTE but is a valid URL
